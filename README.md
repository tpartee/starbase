## Materials, Components and Other Quantities:
    Basic Material (mat_basic) - Common materials such as hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, iron, etc. which are easily found everywhere in the galaxy.
    Intermediate Material (mat_inter) - Slightly less common elements which are still abundant such as aluminum, copper, silicon and others.
    Advanced Material (mat_adv) - Uncommon materials which are usually found in small pockets scattered around the galaxy like gold, lead and cadmium.
    Rare Materials (mat_rare) - Rare meterials which are only found in trace amounts scattered across the galaxy which include elements such as irridium, palladium and platinum.
    Synth Materials (mat_synth) - Materials not found in nature but which can be synthesized in labs which have highly unusual or unique properties.
    Exotic Material (mat_exotic) - Extremely powerful and dangerous materials often used for scientific research or high-energy production or weapons.
    Energy Crystals (mat_crystal) - Exceedingly rare high-density crystals with a special lattice containing uinique properties which can be used to generate large amounts of stable power, but the crystals burn out with time.
    Waste Material (mat_waste) - Undesirable inorganic materials which are difficult to process back into useful materials again.
    Bio Material (mat_bio) - Organic materials which are necessary for most biology to provide energy and growth. Can also be used to synthesize many organic compounds.
    Bio Waste (mat_biowaste) - Organic waste materials from biological processes, most of which can be reverted into useful biological material again with time, energy and catalysts.
    Structural Components (comp_structure) - These components are used to build the structure of your starbase, typically made from lightweight high-tensile carbon-metal alloys and composites.
    Basic Components (comp_basic) - Simple machinery and circuits built using very common materials - easy to manufacture and commonly used in most construction.
    Intermediate Components (comp_inter) - Slightly more advanced modular parts which rely on intermediate materials for alloys or specific manufacturing processes.
    Advanced Components (comp_adv) - These components require more advanced materials and processes than the preceding ones and are required for heavier tools and equipment.
    Trade Credits (trade_creds) - Since the Union does not have a trading currency, these credits represent your standardized trading merit with non-Union civilizations.
    Union Credits (union_creds) - These are earned and spent when trading with Union entities for goods, staff and favor. A small stipend is provided by the Union each fortnight.

## Starbase Management Values:
    Life Support (life_support) - 1 point of Life Support equals 1 CM of Basic Materials, 1 point of Life Support can pressurize and 'scrub' 30 tiles and provides air for 33.3 humans per day.
    Power (power) - Measured in Megawatts, starbases can consume extremely large amounts of power. Standby power means "normally traversable" with gravity enabled.
    Compute (compute) - Measured in Terraquads, this represents how much computational power your station has available or needs. Many modules require compute power to operate.
    Habs (hab_*) - Living quarters for Union officers, workers and visitors of all sorts. Everyone on the station needs a place to sleep and function in.
